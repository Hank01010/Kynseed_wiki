# Kynseed_wikinator

First place the kynseed.py file in the Kynseed/Data folder, or copy the following files from the Data directory to the folder containing kynseed.py:

*   AllItems.txt
*   EAItems.txt
*   ItemRatingConditions.xml
*   ItemTraitDetails.xml
*   FishSpawn.xml
*   Ailments.xml
*   AllRecipes.txt

After running the script, if you have Python installed on your OS, it will create several KW___.txt files containing all the useful information :)
Ctrl+F to search for a specific word/item in the text files.
